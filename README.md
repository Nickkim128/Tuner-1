# Tuner-1
A tuner application that collects sound from the user, returns the nearest note to that frequency, and 
shows whether to tune up or down to that note with a 1% margin of error. FYI the AudioKit framework is not installed 
in this GitHub Repository and must be installed into the Xcode Project for the app to work.
